# Maze-Solver-MATLAB-
Solves mazes by outputting images based on input image

Technique used:
This solver employs the technique of backfilling, whereby all neighbours of a maze's border is filled until a line or the solution is left.

Note:
The input image must have clearly defined edges for the maze.

Folder Breakdown (Solved and unsolved mazes are both included in the folders):
  Toy Problem - Helped to build code from a smaller problem
  Labyrinth - Application of code to larger example to check for error
  Final Example - Final check for error and generate examples to present for

File Name Convention:
   1. .....Filled.jpg is an intermediate output before the solution
   2. .....Answer.jpg is final solution
   3. Input mazes do not have any convention
   4. solver.m are the solvers used
